# PlanetReego

An open-source Minecraft plugin for the Minecraft server PlanetReego.
Feel free to have a look around. Everything here is for you to use outside the project.

## Discalimer

This plugin is hosted on the PlanetReego server, although the versions on github and the server may not be synced.

WE DO TAKE DONATIONS BUT THEY GIVE YOU NO COSMETICS/IN-GAME ITEMS/COLOURED NAMES OR ANY INDICATION THAT YOU DONATED AT ALL. IT IS PURELY FOR IF YOU WANT TO HELP US OUT.
THESE DONATIONS ARE NOT FOR PROFIT. IT'S JUST TO KEEP THE SERVER RUNNING. MORE INFORMATION ABOUT DONATIONS CAN BE SEEN ON THE STORE WEBSITE.
